## **Overview**
By 2025, you‚Äôd think we would have leveraged technology better!!! to help individuals with **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** practice their social skills!!!  
Over **75 million people** (~1% of the population)!!! are diagnosed with ASD, yet digital support tools remain limited!  

We read a ton of research articles from universities like Stanford, John Hopkins, Harvard Med and so many many more and realised individuals with ASD often struggle to form **meaningful social connections** due to challenges such as:  
- Difficulty with social norms and nonverbal communication.  
- Trouble understanding social cues and using expressive/receptive language skills.  
- Difficulty conveying thoughts and emotions.  
- Challenges showing empathy to others and even themselves.  

Therapy happens once or twice a week, we bring it to you everyday.

## **Our Solution: Storybook**

We developed **three core components** after extensive research:  

### **1. Read**

- Powered by the **Gemini API** with prompts tailored for autistic individuals.  
- Uses **simple words**, **emojis**, and **careful coloring** to prevent overstimulation and sensory overload.  

### **2. Write**
- Acts as an *emotion journal*.  
- Analyzes entries to help the user understand emotions.  
- Suggests solutions, empathizes with the situation, or helps identify feelings.  

### **3. Emotion**
- Builds emotion recognition skills through quizzes.  
- Shows images of facial expressions and asks the user to identify the emotion.  
- Directly supports cognitive skill development practiced in therapy, now accessible online.
