# Storybook: A Platform for ASD Social Skills Practice
available @ https://www.unfound.cloud/ ðŸ¥°

You would think that by 2025 we would have leveraged tech better to help individuals with ASD practice their social skills. Over 75,000,000 people (1% of the population) are diagnosed with ASD, yet digital support tools remain limited.

According to the University of Arkansas, individuals with ASD often struggle to form **meaningful** social connections due to various challenges - including difficulties with social norms and nonverbal communication. They have trouble understanding social cues, using expressive and receptive language skills, and conveying thoughts and emotions. Many also find it hard to show empathy to others and even themselves.

Enter Storybook - our solution built on **scientific evidence**. There are 3 main components we developed after extensive research:

First, the **Read page** lets you create your own story and guides you through follow-up questions to help process the narrative. The story runs through the Gemini API with prompts specifically designed for people with autism. We use simple words, emojis, and thoughtful coloring to prevent overstimulation and sensory overload.

Next, **Write** acts as an emotion journal. It reads through the entries and serves as a companion who helps better understand emotions. This could mean suggesting solutions to problems, empathizing with the situation, or simply helping them identify what they are feeling.

The **Emotion** tab helps build emotion recognition skills through quizzes. It shows you pictures of facial expressions and asks you to identify the feelings shown. This directly supports the cognitive skill development that many autistic individuals work on in therapy - we're just making it available online.

### Storybook aims to boost cognitive skills using scientifically-proven methods - from generating engaging stories to live journaling with emotional analysis to facial expression training. We even include a dashboard for tracking progress.

We built this using Astro (shiny design hahhaha) with TypeScript, JavaScript, and CSS. We integrated the Gemini Flash 1.5 API and attempted text-to-speech (whether it works... that's another story ðŸ˜…).
