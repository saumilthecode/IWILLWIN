Storybook: A Platform for ASD Social Skills Practice

You would think that by 2025 we would have leveraged tech better to help individuals with ASD practice their social skills. Over 75,000,000 people (1% of the population) are diagnosed with ASD, yet digital support tools remain limited.

According to the University of Arkansas, individuals with ASD often struggle to form meaningful social connections due to various challenges - including difficulties with social norms and nonverbal communication. They have trouble understanding social cues, using expressive and receptive language skills, and conveying thoughts and emotions. Many also find it hard to show empathy to others and even themselves.

Enter Storybook - our solution built on scientific evidence. There are 3 main components we developed after extensive research:

First, the Read page lets you create your own story and guides you through follow-up questions to help process the narrative. The story runs through the Gemini API with prompts specifically designed for people with autism. We use simple words, emojis, and thoughtful coloring to prevent overstimulation and sensory overload.

Next, Write acts as an emotion journal. It reads through your entries and serves as a companion who helps you better understand your emotions. This could mean suggesting solutions to problems, empathizing with your situation, or simply helping you identify what you're feeling.

The Emotion tab helps build emotion recognition skills through quizzes. It shows you pictures of facial expressions and asks you to identify the feelings shown. This directly supports the cognitive skill development that many autistic individuals work on in therapy - we're just making it available online.

Storybook aims to boost cognitive skills using scientifically-proven methods - from generating engaging stories to live journaling with emotional analysis to facial expression training. We even include a dashboard for tracking progress.

Tech Stack:
We built this using ASTRO (the cleanest, swiftest and most fun!) with TypeScript, JavaScript, and CSS. We integrated the Gemini Flash 1.5 API (thanks for the generous credits!) and attempted text-to-speech (whether it works... that's another story ðŸ˜…). Freeform helped us prototype without endless code rewrites.

Challenges? 
- Multitasking between lectures and debugging -_-
- That fun hour when everything except the buttons showed up (but teamwork and StackOverflow got us through!)

We're super proud of every feature we built, actually implementing nearly everything we thought of. While working on this, we learned tons - including an initial 3-hour detour into ASD datasets that taught us about data training, even though we ultimately went a different direction. And our StackOverflow skills? Through the roof!

What's next for Storybook? Well, my cousin brother who has ASD will be our first tester. His feedback, combined with continued research, will help us make it even better.
