1. HTML structure
2. CSS styling in the head section
3. JavaScript functionality in the body

This code creates a web application for emotion recognition training with:
- Difficulty selection
- Video display 
- Emotion selection buttons
- Progress tracking
- Statistics
- Accessibility controls
- Gemini API integration

The code is complete as-is and doesn't need to fill in any blanks. If you want to use this code, you would just need to:

1. Save it as `index.html`
2. Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with an actual Gemini API key
3. Provide actual video content sources
4. Host it on a web server

If you have specific previous code you'd like to merge this with, please share that code and I can help integrate them properly.
